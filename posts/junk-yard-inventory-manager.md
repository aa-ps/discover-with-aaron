# Junk Yard Inventory Manager Project

## Introduction

Inspired by a visit to a local junk yard in search of a rare car part, I observed the need for a system to manage vehicle inventory and available parts efficiently. This project aims to solve that problem by developing an inventory manager application.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed before proceeding:

1. Node.js
2. MySQL (via Docker or any database provider)
3. Docker

## Cloning the GitHub Repository

Clone the project repository with the following command:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/aa-ps/junkyardpro.git
```

## Running the Docker Container
To start the project, run:
```shell
docker compose up
```

## Learning Outcomes
During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in several areas:
* Enhanced my understanding of database interactions and backend development.
* Learned best practices for creating APIs.
* Discovered the utility of GraphQL for similar projects.
* Understood the significance of Docker in project management.
* Grained foundational knowledge in user authentication, including cookies, tokens, and sessions.

# Junk Yard Inventory Manager Project
## Background Information
I was inspired to work on this website when I needed a car part that was not commonly sold and visited a local junk yard.
The business had no way to keep track of the cars in their inventory and what parts were available.
Therefore, I thought it was a good idea to come up with a solution.

# How To Generate Images Using OpenAI 
## Background Information
Lately, there's been a surge of TikTok videos showcasing AI-generated images created using ChatGPT, which sparked my curiosity. However, subscribing to ChatGPT Plus at $20 a month seemed pricey. Therefore, using my existing knowledge with OpenAI's API, I explored a more affordable way to generate images. In this post, I'll guide you through the process of generating images using OpenAI's API.


## Prerequisites
_Before you start, ensure you have the following:_
1. An OpenAI account.
2. An OpenAI API key.
3. Sufficient account funds.
4. Node.js installed.

## Create a Project Folder and JavaScript File
First, create a new folder for your project and add a file named _**generate.js**_. This file will contain the code to generate images. Change your current directory to the newly created folder.

## Install Required NPM Packages
```shell
npm i openai 
```
## Generate and Save the Image Locally
Create the following code in the _**generate.js**_ file to generate and save an image:
```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { writeFile } from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const response = await openai.images.generate({
  model: "dall-e-3",
  prompt:
    "A seven foot blue alien driving a red porsche.",
  n: 1,
  size: "1024x1024",
  response_format: "b64_json", // use 'url' if you prefer to have a link to your image.
});

const imageBase64Data = response.data[0]["b64_json"];
const imageBufferData = Buffer.from(imageBase64Data, "base64");

// Specify the path and filename for the output image
const filePath = "./outputImage.png";

// Write the buffer to a file
writeFile(filePath, imageBufferData, (err) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error("Error saving the image file:", err);
  } else {
    // Shows the formatted prompt and the base64 code.
    console.log(response.data);
  }
});
```
## Generate an Image and Get URL
You can also generate an image and obtain its URL:
```js
import OpenAI from "openai";
import { writeFile } from "fs";

const openai = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
});

const response = await openai.images.generate({
  model: "dall-e-3",
  prompt:
    "A seven foot blue alien driving a red porsche.",
  n: 1,
  size: "1024x1024",
  response_format: "url", // use 'url' if you prefer to have a link to your image.
});

console.log(response.data[0]) // Get response plus the URL to the image
```
## Execute the Code
Run the script using the following command:
```shell
node .\generate.js
```
